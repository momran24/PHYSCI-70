<h1>Assignment 1: Creating a Press-Fit Construction Kit</h1>
<h6>For this part of the assignment, the goal was to "create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways and accounts for laser cutter kerf". I went through many stages/learning opportunities before reaching the final result. Lets's go through them. Shall we?</h6>
<br>
<br>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt #1: The Hexagone ‚è∫Ô∏è</h5>
<br>
First, design. I used Fusion 360's skectch tool to create a 6-sided polygone (hexagon). I then made three 5mm x 10mm notches on every side of the shape.

<br>

Now...Printing!

<p1>My first cut was a hexagonal gear mechanism that could be used to create objects like balls, specifically a soccer ball. My choice to include an excessive amount of notches rendered my design un-attachable as the vertices of the hexagon along with the placement of my notches interfered with the intended desired attachment of the pieces. My failure to remember the measuring of the kerf further amplified the fact that this idea was in desperate need of improvement. </p1>

<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Attempt #2: Sqaure, Triangle, Pentagon ‚èπÔ∏è</h5>

<br><br>
Although there were many sad feelings with the first hexagon attempt, there was still some crucial information learned...one of them being the kerf. Using a caliper to measure the cardboard cutout of the shape turned out to an average of 50.455 which, when subtracted by 49.545 - the shape itself - turns out to a kerf of 0.91mm. Doesn't look right? That's because it isn't! While a step forward as opposed to last time, this miscalculation in the kerf led to the area between the notches to be to small resulting in the inability to fit the pices together as they were too tight for each other. What a bummer...

<br><br>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Final Attempt: Triangle üîº</h5>
<p1>Remeasuring the kerf, it came out to a more reasonable 0.365mm. Using this new information, I hopped onto Fusion 360 and started to sketch my final design...a triangle. Knowing that the thickness of the cardboard was 4.4 mm, I subtracted said thickness by the kerf measurement in order to compensate for the "laser dust".</p1>

<br><br>
One Triangle

<br><br><br>
Two Triangles. Fit together tightly whilst still being easy to separate.

<br><br><br>
Or get 12 triangles and cut out a 30cm x 30cm cardboard square and...

<h5 style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: underline;">My final parameters were:</h5>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Kerf: <strong>0.365mm</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Laser Power Min: <strong>65%</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Laser Power Max: <strong>75%</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Laser Speed: <strong>20mm/s</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Triangle Area: <strong>9585.95 mm^2</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Triangle Side-Legnth: <strong>150mm</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Triangle Thickness: <strong>4.4mm</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Notch Depth: <strong>10mm</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Notch Side: <strong>3.375mm</strong></p>
